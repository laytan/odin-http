# package nbio

Package nbio implements a non blocking IO abstraction layer over several platform specific APIs.

This package implements an event loop based abstraction.

*TODO:*

- Windows implementation has a bug I can't figure out where we can only retrieve one queued event at a time
- Benchmarking
- Some UDP implementations

*APIs:*

- Windows: [IOCP (IO Completion Ports)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output_completion_port)
- Linux:   [io_uring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Io_uring)
- Darwin:  [KQueue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kqueue)

*How to read the code:*

The file nbio.odin can be read a little bit like a header file,
it has all the procedures heavily explained and commented and dispatches them to platform specific code.

You can also have a look at the tests for more general usages, the example below or the generated docs even further below.

```odin
/*
This example shows a simple TCP server that echos back anything it receives.

Better error handling and closing/freeing connections are left for the reader.
